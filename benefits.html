    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>
      Plastic was initially seen as a miracle material â€“ lightweight, durable, waterproof, cheap, and versatile. 
      It was used in packaging, healthcare (syringes, gloves), electronics, transportation, and food storage.
    </p>

    <h2>How Benefits Turned Into Disadvantages</h2>
    <p>
      Over the years, these benefits turned into disadvantages due to overproduction, single-use culture, and lack of recycling. 
      Plastic that was once helpful is now polluting air, water, and soil, and entering human bodies as microplastics.
