    <h2>
  <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">1. Early Beginnings (1800s ‚Äì The Birth of Synthetic Materials)</h3>
</h2>
<p>
  In the mid-19th century, natural materials like <b>ivory</b>, <b>shellac</b>, and <b>rubber</b> were widely used but were limited and expensive. <br>
  <b>1862</b> ‚Äì <b>Alexander Parkes</b> invented <b>Parkesine</b>, the first man-made plastic, which was derived from cellulose. It wasn‚Äôt very stable but opened the door for future inventions. <br>
  <b>1869</b> ‚Äì <b>John Wesley Hyatt</b> created <b>Celluloid</b>, which was mainly used for billiard balls, combs, and film reels. This was the first successful semi-synthetic plastic.
</p>
<h2>
  <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">2. The Rise of Modern Plastics (1900‚Äì1930s)</h3>
</h2>
<p>
  <b>1907</b> ‚Äì <b>Leo Baekeland</b> invented <b>Bakelite</b>, the first fully synthetic plastic, made without any natural molecules. It was durable, heat-resistant, and electrical-insulating. <br>
  This made plastics useful in telephones, radios, and electrical appliances. In the <b>1920s‚Äì30s</b>, new plastics like <b>PVC</b> (<b>Polyvinyl Chloride</b>) and <b>Polystyrene</b> (<b>PS</b>) were discovered.
</p>
<h2>
  <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">3. World War II Era (1939‚Äì1945) ‚Äì The Boom</h3>
</h2>
<p>
  Plastics became a war material substitute because metals were scarce.<br>
  <b>Nylon</b> (<b>1935</b>) ‚Äì by <b>DuPont</b>, was used for parachutes, ropes, and uniforms. It was also used for women‚Äôs stockings, which became very popular.<br>
  <b>Polyethylene</b> (<b>PE</b>) ‚Äì was used as an insulator for radar cables. <br>
  Plastics proved to be cheap, lightweight, and strong, making them essential in war and later in civilian life.
</p>
<h2>
  <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">4. Post-War Consumer Expansion (1950s‚Äì1970s)</h3>
</h2>
<p>
  After WWII, plastic entered everyday life in the form of packaging, furniture, toys, and kitchenware.<br>
  <b>1954</b> ‚Äì <b>Polypropylene</b> (<b>PP</b>) was invented.<br>
  By the <b>1960s</b>, plastic was replacing wood, glass, and metal in many industries. <br>
  <b>PET</b> (<b>Polyethylene Terephthalate</b>) was introduced in the <b>1970s</b>, which revolutionized beverage bottles.
</p>
<h2>
  <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">5. Global Domination (1980s‚Äì2000s)</h3>
</h2>
<p>
  Plastics became a mass consumer material used in electronics, automobiles, medical devices, and clothing fibers (<b>polyester</b>). <br>
  Their cheap production and versatility meant plastics were everywhere. But concerns began to arise about waste, pollution, and non-biodegradability.
</p>
<h2>
  <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">6. Present Day (2000s‚ÄìNow)</h3>
</h2>
<p>
  Plastics are now in every industry: construction, transport, packaging, textiles, medicine, and electronics. Annual production exceeds <b>400 million tonnes</b> worldwide. <br>
  The focus is shifting toward <b>bioplastics</b>, recycling, and sustainable alternatives to reduce environmental harm.
</p>
<h2>
  <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Types of Plastics</h3>
</h2>
<p>
  There are <b>7</b> major categories (with countless variations): <br>
  <b>Polyethylene</b> (<b>PE</b>) ‚Äì bags, bottles, containers.<br>
  <b>Polypropylene</b> (<b>PP</b>) ‚Äì automotive parts, textiles, food containers.<br>
  <b>Polyvinyl Chloride</b> (<b>PVC</b>) ‚Äì pipes, cables, flooring.<br>
  <b>Polystyrene</b> (<b>PS</b>) ‚Äì disposable cups, foam packaging.<br>
  <b>Polyethylene Terephthalate</b> (<b>PET</b>) ‚Äì drink bottles, textiles.<br>
  <b>Acrylic</b>, <b>Nylon</b>, <b>Polycarbonate</b> ‚Äì lenses, gears, fibers.<br>
  <b>Bioplastics</b> ‚Äì <b>PLA</b>, <b>PHA</b> made from corn, sugarcane, etc.
