        The history of modern plastic begins with the work of <b>Leo Baekeland</b>, a Belgian-American chemist. In <b>1907</b>, he created the first fully synthetic plastic, which he named <b>Bakelite</b>. His goal was to find a material that was strong, heat-resistant, and could be molded into different shapes, all while being more affordable than natural resources. Bakelite was a revolutionary invention because it was not derived from any natural substances, marking the birth of a new era of materials.

The name <b>"PLASTIC"</b> is a perfect description of the material's most important property. It comes from the Greek word <b>"plastikos,"</b> which means <b>"capable of being molded or shaped." </b>This name directly refers to how the material behaves when heated—it becomes pliable and can be formed into various shapes, and then it holds that shape once it cools. This unique characteristic is what made it so versatile and useful for countless applications.
